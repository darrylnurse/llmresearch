The idea to associate Thanksgiving with the Pilgrims was introduced by Alexander Young in 1841, identifying the 1621 feast as the inaugural Thanksgiving in New England. It wasn't until the 20th century that the Pilgrims became iconic symbols of the holiday.
The ability to predict earthquakes remains elusive, with no successful methods developed despite numerous attempts. Scientists are certain that future earthquakes will occur along specific faults, but the timing of these events is unpredictable.
Koalas, needing 22 hours of sleep daily, top the list of the most lethargic animals, followed by sloths, armadillos, opossums, lemurs, hamsters, and squirrels in order of their sleep requirements.
In Seattle, the average year includes 226 days with overcast skies — the fourth highest in the United States — alongside 81 days of partial cloudiness, and it experiences rainfall on 155 days, 97 of which have already occurred this year.
Circumhorizontal arcs, or "upside-down rainbows," occur when sunlight filters through high-altitude ice crystals, producing a phenomenon completely unrelated to rainfall.
The term "hamburger" is derived from the city of Hamburg, Germany, where in the late 18th century, sailors between Hamburg and New York City often ate tough, salted beef patties called "Hamburg steak."
Following the relocation of Houston's original NFL team to Nashville to become the Tennessee Titans, the Houston Texans were introduced as an expansion team in 2002, with Bob McNair as the principal owner.
In 1777, after 16 months of deliberation, the Continental Congress in York, Pennsylvania, decided to adopt the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union. It wasn't until March 1, 1781, that Maryland, the last of the 13 states, ratified the documents.

The apple tree, along with its wild ancestor Malus sieversii, hails from Central Asia and has been cultivated for thousands of years in Asia and Europe before being introduced to North America by European colonizers.
The distance between Mars and the sun varies, with its farthest point (aphelion) being 154 million miles (249 million km) away, and its closest point (perihelion) at 128 million miles (206 million km), averaging a distance of 141 million miles (228 million km).
Theoretically, the closest distance between Mars and Earth could occur when Mars is nearest to the sun (at perihelion) and Earth is farthest (at aphelion), potentially bringing them within 33.9 million miles (54.6 million kilometers) of each other, though this has never been documented.
Lobsters are distinguished by gender as males (cocks) and females (hens or chickens for those weighing about one pound). A lobster with one claw is known as a cull, and without any claws, it is called a pistol.
The act of popping a joint involves stretching the joint capsule, allowing gas to escape rapidly and form bubbles in the synovial fluid. To pop the same joint again, one must wait for the gases to reabsorb into the fluid.
When a rotating thunderstorm system's winds do not exceed 62 km/hr (38 mph), it is classified as a tropical depression. It graduates to a tropical storm at 63 km/hr (39 mph) and becomes a hurricane once winds reach 119 km/hr (74 mph).
The Apollo 11 mission successfully landed the first humans, Americans Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, on the Moon on July 20, 1969. Armstrong was the first to set foot on the lunar surface hours later.
In the production of Swiss cheese, P. shermani bacteria consume lactic acid and emit carbon dioxide, forming bubbles that result in the cheese's distinctive holes.
By measuring the shadow of a tower in Alexandria at the Summer Solstice and knowing the distance to Syene was roughly 800 km, Eratosthenes was able to calculate the Earth's circumference, taking into account that the Sun was not positioned directly overhead.
The seeds of the coffee plant, housed inside a fruit commonly referred to as a cherry, are known as coffee beans. Their bean-like appearance has given rise to their familiar name, despite their nature as seeds.
New York set the precedent in 1901 for automobile registration, leading to a nationwide requirement for license plates by 1918. The implementation of driver's licensing, however, progressed slowly, with only 39 states issuing them by 1935 and few mandating a proficiency test, despite public safety concerns.
The Rotunda of the National Archives Building in Washington, DC, presents the Declaration of Independence for public viewing, securely alongside the United States Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
Papua New Guinea holds the record for the most linguistic diversity globally, with 820 native languages. The dominant languages are English and Tok Pisin, or New Guinea Pidgin, the latter being a linguistic legacy of the colonial era and the most spoken language besides English.
Secondary rainbows emerge from the double reflection of sunlight in raindrops, appearing at a 50–53° angle outside the primary rainbow, with the sequence of colors inverted—blue on the outer edge and red on the inner.
Living in the water, whales, which are mammals, do not possess sweat glands, an adaptation unnecessary for their marine environment.
Vanilla's origin is linked to the Vanilla genus of orchids, initially found in Mesoamerica, including regions of what are now Mexico and Guatemala. These orchids, climbing like vines on trees, yield the vanilla beans through their pods.
Sushi typically features select fish such as tuna (maguro, shiro-maguro), Japanese amberjack (yellowtail, hamachi), snapper (kurodai), mackerel (saba), and salmon (sake), with toro, the belly fat of the fish, being highly sought after for its rich flavor.
